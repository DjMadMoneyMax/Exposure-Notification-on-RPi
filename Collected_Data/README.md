# Description
This folder stores some data collected by two Raspberry Pi 3. One is called Device A while the other one is called Device B. The distance between two devices is given in the filename. 

Note that in the collected data, there are a few non-sense rows, such as the RSSI is -4294967234 dBm and the RPI is not the same with other rows. I am not sure why this happens, but I will just throw the non-sense rows since they are not many.
