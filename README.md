# Exposure-Notification-on-RPi

Codes and Data for the Exposure Notification on the Raspberry Pi. 

## How to Run The Codes

I write it here in case I forget how to run it in the future. First, the bash script (.sh) needs to be executable. To achieve this, run

`chmod +x ContractTracing_BLE.sh` 

Then, run the bash script by typing `./ContractTracing_BLE.sh`

Done!


## To do List

1. Revise config file so that both bash script and Python can read and import it.
2. Change to the absolute path or current path. 
3. Add function to log the fail events.
4. Change to the new Apple-Google message format.
